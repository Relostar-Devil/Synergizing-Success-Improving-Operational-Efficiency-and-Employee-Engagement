# **Problem Statement:**


 Enhancing Operational Efficiency and Growth Strategies in a Multi-Departmental Business

 
 # **Context:**
 
 Business operations involve a complex interaction between departments, products, suppliers, and employees, where each element contributes to overall performance. Challenges such as managing inventory levels,
 optimizing employee performance, maintaining customer satisfaction, and navigating supply chain dependencies require constant data analysis for informed decision-making. Effective alignment between leadership,
 employees, and market trends is also crucial for future planning and sustainable growth.

 
# **Problem:**

 ● The company is experiencing several operational inefficiencies:
 
 ● Employee Performance & Retention Challenges: Inconsistent employee performance and high turnover rates negatively impact productivity. The
   company needs to evaluate whether training programs, salary, and tenure influence employee retention and performance.
 
 ● Product Sales & Customer Satisfaction Issues: Some products have low customer feedback scores despite high sales, indicating potential quality or
   support issues. Additionally, low sales for certain products may suggest gaps in marketing strategies or misalignment with market demands.
 
 ● Supply Chain & Inventory Management Issues: Supply chain risks are posed by low inventory levels approaching reorder points, potentially leading to missed sales opportunities if not addressed promptly.

 ● Technology Usage & Future Planning Concerns: The company is underutilizing technology in several departments, leading to inefficiencies. Weak market research and unclear company direction could affect
   long-term growth and competitiveness.
